# Nagios Registration
===================

If you have a large number of servers you manage through a deployment system (such as Ansible, Puppet, or whatnot), and you want to use Nagios to monitor them, this app can help you.  Nagios Registration supports:

* Adding new hosts programatically
* Creating and managing host groups
* Adding services
* Assigning services to hosts
